Knowing that the technological advancements are in a way contributing towards the mental disorders in people nowadays, a system that efficient predicts the possible mental health condition and the best apt treatment analyis, would be a great way to sort things out, atlease by 10%. Keeping this in mind, the project aims to provide a solution The dataset used is from a 2014 survey that measures the thoughts/attitudes of techies towards mental health and also the frequency of mental health disorders faced by them in the tech workplace. 

# Methodology

In order to obtain an accurate prediction of mental health treatment based on the available dataset, individual models have been used and also an ensemble1 of models used has been incorporated. The models used are - K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Boosting (Adaboost), Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Classifier.

# Accuracy obtained:



# Mental Health Prediction : 
Major goal of this project is to optimize treatment decision-making, increase the likelihood of positive outcomes, and improve the overall quality of mental healthcare, while attempting to find the best model to predict the treatment requirement by experimenting with various ML algorithms.

Additionally, the project aims at exploring and quantifying the mutual influences between features like age, physical health factors and mental health treatment, which is achieved by conducting exhaustive analysis of every feature and visualizing the correlation.
